# Projects For Learning

You will find few of my projects which i have done on publicly available data sets for learning purpose 

## Libraries used 


```bash
1) Pandas            - Data Manipulation and Data Handling
2) NumPy             - Mathematical Calculations
3) Stats-Models      - For Multilinear Regression and Classification , Forecasting
4) Scikit-learn      - For varies Algorithms i.e. Algorithms for Regression, Classification, Clustering, NLP
5) Matplotlib        - Visualization
6) Seaborn           - Visualization
```
